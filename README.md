Project Description: Be the laser.

### Attribution and Disclaimers

This is a school project and replication of the game [Burnout](https://mrkos.itch.io/burnout), created by [mrkos](https://itch.io/profile/mrkos) and [WinstonWalrus](https://winstonwalrus.itch.io/) for ScoreSpace Jam #15 on itch.io in September of 2021. It came in 3rd place out of 49 entries.

This project was created using Unity. The sprites used for gameplay were found on KenneyNL [here](https://kenney.nl/assets/space-shooter-redux) and are licensed using CC0 1.0 Universal. The background image of the game is an image captured/generated by NASA and the ESA, found [here](https://images.nasa.gov/details-PIA17563) and titled "Crab Nebula, as Seen by Herschel and Hubble". It was captured using the Hubble Space Telescope and is not subject to any copyright (see: [NASA media usage guidelines](https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/guidelines/index.html)). That image was color-shifted and dimmed by me.
